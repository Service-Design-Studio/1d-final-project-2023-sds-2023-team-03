Feature: Fetching sales data for a specific product category relative to PUMAâ€™s own data.

  Scenario: Fetching sales data (Happy)
    Given I have the default category and time period selected on the sales page ("Running" and "Last 30 days")
    When I press the "Search" button
    Then the "Search" button should grey out
    Then I should see the queried data reflected on the bar graph in the sales page
    And the header on top of the table should reflect the query parameters

  Scenario: Fetching sales data with no input on time period text box (Sad)
    Given I have switched out the time period presets for the "time period" text box on the sales page, but have not entered a valid time period
    When I press the "Search" button
    Then an error message should appear on the screen instructing the user to select a valid time period

  Scenario: Clicking the "Search" button again while data is being fetched (Sad)
    Given I have pressed the "Search" button with a valid category and time period on the sales page, and the "search" button is still grey
    When I press the "Search" button again
    Then I should still see the loading message, and nothing else should happen

  Scenario: Search timeout (Sad)
    Given I have pressed "Search" with valid inputs
    When 10 seconds pass without a response from the server
    Then the search should terminate
    And the search button should become clickable again
    And I should receive a search timeout message modal

  Scenario: Switching graph - Product Frequency (Happy)
    Given I have pressed "Search" with valid inputs
    And the results have returned
    And the segment control is not currently on "Product Frequency"
    When I click on "Product Frequency"
    Then the current graph should be replaced by the "Product Frequency" graph

  Scenario: Switching graph - Product Revenue (Happy)
    Given I have pressed "Search" with valid inputs
    And the results have returned
    And the segment control is not currently on "Product Revenue"
    When I click on "Product Revenue"
    Then the current graph should be replaced by the "Product Revenue" graph

  Scenario: Switching graph - Apparel Frequency (Happy)
    Given I have pressed "Search" with valid inputs
    And the results have returned
    And the segment control is not currently on "Apparel Frequency"
    When I click on "Apparel Frequency"
    Then the current graph should be replaced by the "Apparel Frequency" graph

  Scenario: Switching graph - Apparel Revenue (Happy)
    Given I have pressed "Search" with valid inputs
    And the results have returned
    And the segment control is not currently on "Apparel Revenue"
    When I click on "Apparel Revenue"
    Then the current graph should be replaced by the "Apparel Revenue" graph

  Scenario: Switching graphs - self (Sad)
    Given I have pressed "Search" with valid inputs
    And the results have returned
    When I click on a graph segment option that I am already on
    Then the same graph as before should still be visible, and nothing should change
